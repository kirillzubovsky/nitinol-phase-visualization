### üìö Documentation

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples and use cases
- Translate documentation to other languages
- Create video tutorials or blog posts

### üé® Design and Visualization

- Improve color schemes for accessibility
- Create better default viewing angles
- Design educational posters or infographics
- Enhance UI/UX for kid-friendly interaction

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Discuss First**: Open an issue to discuss major changes before implementing
2. **Keep It Educational**: Remember the target audience (kids, students, educators)
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure changes work with existing parameters
4. **Document**: Update README.md and add code comments
5. **Test**: Verify the visualization renders correctly

### Crystal Structure Accuracy

When adding new phases or structures:
- Reference peer-reviewed literature
- Include citations in code comments
- Validate lattice parameters
- Test with known experimental data

### Performance Considerations

- Keep atom counts reasonable (< 200 atoms for smooth interaction)
- Optimize rendering for real-time rotation
- Test on different hardware configurations

## Submission Process

1. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for visual changes
   - Explain educational benefits

4. **Code Review**
   - Respond to feedback constructively
   - Make requested changes
   - Keep the discussion focused and professional
